    The generic Celery task that acts as the Event Bus publisher.

    It determines which listener task should receive the event based on event_type
    and then dispatches the message. In a simple Celery setup, this is often
    done by routing or by calling the appropriate listener task directly.

    NOTE: In a real-world Kafka/RabbitMQ system, this task would instead
    send the serialized payload to the broker. Here, we use direct task calls
    to simulate the routing functionality.
